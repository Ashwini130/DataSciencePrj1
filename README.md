Basic of Python and Data Science

Made a simple Data Science Project to explore the domain and learn something new :D



The project's motive is Data Analysis to understand which kind of apps attract maximum users in appstores.

An app with a genre and a particular type that appeals most to the people is proposed.

Basic Outline of what was done:
- Cleaning the data(by removing duplicates, removing non - english apps etc.(as per our need and interest))
- The apps are sorted and analysed by average ratings and a recommendation is proposed.
